# AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

- Always disucss in "中文" with user and write document and code in English.
- Always run testing after code changes to ensure code quality.
- Always run `make coverage` to evaluate test coverage and fix as needed.
- Always ask "should I add more testing" and make robust but not over-engineering testing.
- Always document the "Why" (reasoning/analysis) alongside the "How" (decision/implementation) in design discussion documents.
- Reminder: Add timeout to test if potential stuck.
- Reminder: Fix everything in one pass—search globally first, then verify and echo back, so the user never has to repeat the same request.

## 🚨 STOP CONDITIONS

IMMEDIATELY STOP and ask user when:

- Authentication/permission errors
- Need to add new dependencies
- Creating new architectural patterns
- **Ambiguous Intent**: If user says "load task", "check this", or "investigate", ONLY analyze and plan. DO NOT CODE.

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN PATTERNS

- Using `cat` or `echo` to write or append to files in the terminal.
- Start coding without a **confirmed plan** from the user.
- Adding "Generated with Claude Code", "via Happy", or any co-author credits in commit messages.
- **Git commits without explicit single-use authorization**: Each git commit instruction only authorizes ONE commit. Never auto-commit or batch commit without explicit user consent for each commit.
- **Git force push**: Never use `git push --force` or `git push -f`. Use `git push --force-with-lease` only when absolutely necessary and with explicit user consent.

## 🔄 DECISION TREE

Before ANY file creation:

1. Can I modify existing file? → Do that
2. Is there a similar file? → Copy and modify
3. Neither? → Ask user first

Before ANY change:

1. Will this need new imports? → Check if already available

## 📝 HIERARCHY RULES

- Check for AGENTS.md in current directory
- Subdirectory rules compliment root rules
- If conflict → subdirectory wins

## Preference

- Use `github.com/stretchr/testify` for Golang tests.
- Uses `bun` for frontend package scripts.
- Tasks are located in `tasks` folder
- Design docs are located in `docs\design` folder
